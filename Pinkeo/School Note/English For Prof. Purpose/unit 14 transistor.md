<h1>Unit 14 Transistors</h1>
**what dose it do?
All about Transistors** 
[[Unit 15]]
A transistor is a device that determines the flow and quantity of current. Transistors have the ability to switch and **amplify** electronics signals.

There are serveral different types of Transistor: the **bipolar transistor**, the **jucntion field effect transistor (JFET)** and the **metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET)**. Both FET and bipolar transistors need a **bias** voltage in order to turn on.

A bipolar transistor has three terminals. An electrical current flows into the first terminal, knows as the **base**. The base changes the current flow between the **emitter** and **collector**.

Field effect transistors also have three terminals. However, The terminals have different names: the **gate**,**source,** and **drain**. The other different is that the voltage applied to the gate changes the current flow between the source and drain. MOSFETs have two main operating modes: **enhancement mode** and **depletion mode**. Depletion mode transistors are "normally on" , whereas enhancement mode transistors are "normaly off"..

	**1. Before you read the passage talk about these questions.**
		1. what are two types of transistor?
		**ans:** Bipolar transistors and junction field effect transistors are two types of transistor.
		2. What are the three terminals in a FET transistor?
		**ans:** The gate ,source, and drain are the three terminals in FET transistor.
	
<h2>Ready</h2>
	**2. Read the article, Then ,complate the table.**
		transistors   |  imfomation
		**Bipolar**    :  three terminals called the base, emmiter and collector: The base changes the current flow between the emitter and collector.
		**JFET**       : three terminals called the gate, source and drain. Voltage applied to the gate changes the passage of current between the source and drain.
		**MOSFET**   : similar to the JFET. Has two modes: enchacement mode and depletion mode. In depletion mode, transistors are "normaly on", In enhancement mode they are "normaly off".

		1. amplify > **_F_**. to increase the power of signal
		2. bias > **_D_.** a fixed voltage ,applied to a device, in order to control its operation
		3. drain > **_G**._ the part of a FET that dose the same job as collector
		4. enchancement mode > **A.** an operationg mode where the chennel is free of charge carriers when the gate source voltage is zero
		5. gate > **E.** the controling terminal that alters the current flow between the source and drain
		6. JFET >  **C.** a type of transistor that has a gate , source, and drain.
		7. source > **B.** the part of a transistor where charge-carrying holes originate.
	4. **Read the sentence pair. Choose where the words best fit the blanks.**	
		1. 
			A: ***Depletion mode*** transistors are devices that are "normaly on"
			B: The ***base*** changes the flow of current between two terminals.
		2.
			A: ***MOSFET*** is a kind of transistor that requires the least amount of signal current in order to turn on.
			B: The ***emitter*** is the section of a transistor where charge-carrying holes originate
		3.
			A: Once charge carriers have left the base they flow into the ***collector***
			B: A ***bipolar transistor*** is a piece of equipment used to amplify and switch electronic signals.
	**5. Listen and read the article again What do transistors do?**
	**ans:** Transistor control the flow and quantity of current .They can switch and amplify electronic signals.
	<h2>Listen</h2>
	**6. Listen to the conversation between a customer and a tech. Mark following statements as true (T) or false (f).**
		1. The computer model is usually a good one **T**
		2. the computer's transistor does not work correctly **T**
		3. The man offer to give her computer. **F**
	**7. Listen again and complete the conversation.**
	**Customer:** I bought this computer here last week, and i'm already having problem with it.
	**tech:** I apologize for the ***inconvenience*** . Can i take a look at it?
	**C:** Sure, but i don't know that i still want it.  What kind of computer breaks ***after one week***.
	**T:** i'm so sorry  it's given you difficulties. We don't usually have problem with ***this model***.
	**C:** Really?
	**T:** Okay, I think i know what the issue is. According to your computer's ***serial number***, it's part of a batch that got faulty transistors.
	**C:** Well that ***explains it*** 
	**T:** I can ***replace the transistor*** fairly easily.
